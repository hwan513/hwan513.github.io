- In a team of six people we built an open-sourced web app for Blurple Canvas and r/place inspired collaborative digital art canvas.
- [Project Blurple](https://projectblurple.com) is a week-long community run project celebrating the birthday of
  Discord.
- The application was soft-launched during the Project Blurple event in 2024, where mainly the discord bot handled
  the interactions with the canvas. In 2025, we deprecated the discord bot and focused on the web app.
- During initial development, I was mainly responsible for writing the backend and writing test cases. Later on, I took
  on adding improvements to the frontend, including making it runnable on Safari. This required a major re-write to our custom
  built canvas panning and zooming system. This eventually led to me also implementing a mobile interactive and
  responsive UI which saw major use in the 2025 event.
- During the 2025 event, I remained active fixing any scalability and browser compatibility issues that arose. Including
  a weird bug seen only on Android Firefox and very minorly on Safari.
