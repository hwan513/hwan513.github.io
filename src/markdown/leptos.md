## Leptos Tech Demo

### Rust,&nbsp;Leptos,&nbsp;CSS

- A simple application that demonstrates what the Leptos framework has to offer, including very simple pokedex page
  using the public PokeAPI.
- This wasn't my first foray into Rust frontend frameworks (that belongs to my initial portfolio website). However it
  was my first time learning the ins and outs of a frontend framework in the context of Rust, going Routing with Outlets
  to Suspense, Await all that jazz.
- This was originally created as a demo for an assignment + video (I'll have to try find the footage). So it covers the large amount of what a CSR rust framework can do.
- DISCLAIMER: I would never recommend someone to use any Rust framework, while Rust is a terrific language, in the
  context of frontend development, its developer experience is painful. Compile times are slow, and error messages remind
  me of the Java stack traces. So would I keep using Leptos? Yeah probably, I'm a sucker for that stuff, and it does help
  me learn a lot.
