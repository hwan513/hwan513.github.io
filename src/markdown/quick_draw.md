## Quick, Draw!

### Java,&nbsp;JavaFX,&nbsp;Maven

- Quick, Draw! was my first major group project during Uni. As a group of three, we were task to create this Java-based desktop game for young adults.
- The main goal of the game is to have the neural network correctly guess your prompt.
- The game offers various difficulty levels, three game modes (Classic, Hidden Word, and Zen), and allows users to create custom profiles with profile pictures, player statistics, and badges.
- I was mainly responsible for implementing the various game modes, profile pictures, and providing feedback on pull requests.
