### Typescript,&nbsp;React,&nbsp;Vite

- Typefaceoff is a react web app for comparing typefaces (its in the name!). This project is quite unique, as it was a group project structured as an exercise learning the best practices for working in open source space. As such, a lot of my efforts went into learning the best ways to ensure that the code was maintainable.
- This involved more learning about the overall JavaScript tooling ecosystem, as well as integrating it with CI
  (GitHub actions) and CD (GitHub pages), which I all setup.
- This knowledge has carried on into many of my later projects (including many group projects), where I am able to use my prior knowledge to ensure
  ease-of-use, and high code quality.
- I do intend on eventually rewriting this project to more suite my own sense.
