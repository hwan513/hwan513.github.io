# About me üë®‚Äçüíª

Hey, I‚Äôm Henry, a software engineering graduate from the University of Auckland. I'm your go to guy for being
hyperfixated on optimising and improving everything (almost negatively so), however this fuels my extraordinary drive
for learning and grinding away on delivering the best that I can do.

A bit about my coding endeavours, I was first introduced to programming in 2021 as part of the general first year engineering and it just somehow clicked. By the end of that year, I was already trying to complete Advent of Code using a mishmash of C, MATLAB, and Python.

During that time I also became enamoured with using Vim (and later Neovim), which has (unfortunately) turned me into an overall configuration nerd. This hasn't stopped me learning more about existing frontend technologies. However, I have seemed to become and esoteric programming language polyglot, with an appetite for frankly cursed things such as Rust frontends, and hours upon hours poured into writing bash and lua scripts.

Some fun facts about me:

- Outside of programming, I enjoy weight training and sports (currently badminton).
- I attempted to learn Teeline shorthand, and the sturdy keyboard layout (and currently use Dvorak)
- The painting on the right (also used as the favicon), is a painting I made in year 11 and has served me well as
  profile picture.
