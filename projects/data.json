The site is built using Sycamore, which is a framework that compiles written Rust code into HTML and WebAssembly. Perseus is used to generate a static site at build time and I have used vanilla CSS to allow fine-grained control over the design. It is currently hosted on GitHub pages with the build and deployment process automated using a GitHub action.",
